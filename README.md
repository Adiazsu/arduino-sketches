Arduino Sketches
My personal Arduino Sketches, including 2 projects:
- AHOB: an aduino controlling a dutch railway crossing, with 2 gates and blinking lights
- StampBug: an arduino replacing the basic stamp brain of an old StampBug robotic bug
- BMW_Z4: a sketch to control the on-board navigation display, using the stepper motor and an arduino motor shield
